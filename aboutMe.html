		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<br>
		<h4>Name: Precious Saelee</h4>
		<p>For a little bio about myself, my birthday is in February on a day I most likely won't tell, being a year of the snake. In my family, got great parents and one annoying younger bro. Something a little bout my personality: active, energetic, and a loyal friend. Coding is a passion I had since I was little, but never really got the chance till now.</p>
